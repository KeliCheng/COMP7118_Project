# COMP7118_Project

Redid the recommender system.
- Now uses a Singular-Value Decomposition equivalent of User-Item based recommendation.
- Added a third option to enter movies directly and see the result.

Make sure you have an internet connection before running the recommender.
Launch by running main.py in the project root folder.
